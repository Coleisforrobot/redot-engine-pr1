## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Redot Engine](https://www.redotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface, based on Godot Engine.** It provides a
comprehensive set of common tools, so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and consoles.
